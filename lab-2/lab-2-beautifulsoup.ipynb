It has an average rating of 3.33, which is extraordinarily dismal by this website’s standards (and with almost a quarter million ratings so far, it is unlikely to migrate much from that figure).

The particular edition I read from University of California Press is HIGHLY recommended as the typeface is extremely agreeable to the eyes and the illustrations are subtle and instructive without ever interfering or drawing attention away from the story. Perhaps that’s where the latent interest grew deep in my soul as regards the whaling museums and since life offered me recently the opportunity to see and enjoy both, I grabbed at the chance and am so glad to have done so. This reading of Melville is so much more interesting having now a lot more background on the various factors (social, economic, and physical) that informed the writing and structure of the story.\n",

      "                    Many modern readers have been turned off of the unabridged Moby-Dick due to the many chapters of background information that Ishmael feels compelled to pass us about whales and whaling. I can understand that some folks want to get on with the story and don’t want to have all this detail. Personally, the whole book seems so much more real to me now. When I try to imagine the life of the 21-28 people on a 3-5 year whaling mission with a back-breaking job punctuated with long periods of boredom and intense periods of turmoil (whether from ocean storms or from the hunt and ensuing processing of blubber), I can appreciate how the story moves at its own pace and during those long hours at sea while the sailors are working on their scrimshaw or scanning the horizon for spouts, that Ishmael is in his cabin writing all this detail down about this job that he is so incredibly proud of. If you remove this description, it removes much of the texture of the book and reduces it to an adventure story rather than a more universal chez d’oeuvre.\n",

      "                    Several moments merit mention: Father Mapples’ sermon on Jonah (Chapter 9) which sets the tone for most of the book, the speech of Ahab in recruiting his crew into his diabolical mission against Moby-Dick (Chapter 36) and the heart-breaking acquiescence of Starbuck, and my favorite part so far, The Grand Armada (Chapter 89). The description of the whale nursery with the mothers and children looking up through the water at their hunters was spectacular writing and makes one dream of being out there in one of those flimsy boats to see it.\n",
      "                    <br/>\n",

      "                    The writing is by turns ironic, serious, violent, and tender. On one hand is the famous Shark Massacre (Chapter 66) where Melville weaves in an image of the sharks actually eating themselves in their frenzy – amazing realism and exceedingly violent. On the other hand, the cleverness of Stubb as he manages to steal the sick whale with the ambergris away from the hapless French captain of the Rose-Bud (Chapter 91) was hilarious and I laughed out loud. Even the seemingly dry description chapters often have some high degree of tongue-in-cheek such as the suggestion that the Kings and Queens were all coronated in whale-oil (Chapter 25). All of these add a certain unique texture to Moby-Dick and seem to me indispensable to the overall majesty of the book.\n",

      "                    It was a breathless ending as one would expect, but there was also a feeling of anti-climax. I think that despite the excitement of the chase and the apocalyptic ending, I enjoyed the build up of the suspense all during the book to the end. There was a bit of sentimentality towards the end that was not really present during the rest of the text...almost as if Melville was impatient to get to the end, to get the end of Ahab out of his system or something. And the whirlpool that swallows everything but Ishmael is a bit supernatural which shocks after having such vivid realism for the previous 550 pages. It was also strange that after occupying such a central (and tender) role for Ishmael through the first 100-200 pages of the book, Queequeg just disappears from the action. And how is it that, as a green hand, Ishmael suddenly replaces Fedallah in Ahab's boat? That seems like a bit of a stretch to me. But then, I am nit-picking on one of the greatest literary masterpieces of all-time and that probably sounds ridiculous and pretentious perhaps.\n",

Albeit, the last soliloquy of Ahab is one of the best in Moby Dick, it seems almost out of character for him: the whole book he is this dark, moody almost one-dimensional character and suddenly we seem him shedding a tear and opening his heart to the one that nearly shot him, the First Mate Starbuck. Perhaps I am too influenced by television but it seems a bit incongruent this time around.\n",

Besides the obvious coziness between him and Queequeg, the description of his hands deep in spermaceti squeezing pieces of oil but also friends of other sailors performing the same task seemed highly sexualized to me. I really hadn't thought about this aspect of Melville at all and upon doing a bit of research learned that he and Nathaniel Hawthorne of Scarlet Letter fame and to whom Moby-Dick is dedicated may have been lovers.\n",

The last two encounters that are described with other boats are masterful: the contrast with the wild abandon of the Bachelor and the rejection of the forlorn Rachel were both perfect set up for the final acts of this tragedy.\n",

This arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts. First: In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon. In these instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale, as it were, from the one boat to the other; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort. Second: This arrangement is indispensible for common safety's sake; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat, and were the whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single, smoking minute as he sometimes does, he would not stop there, for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of the sea; and in that case no town-crier would ever find her again.\n",

      "                     Before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is taken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is again carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting crosswise upon the loom or handle of every man's oar, so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing; and also passing between the men, as they alternately sit at the opposing gunwales, to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill, prevents it from slipping out. From the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside the boat again; and some ten or twenty fathoms (called box-line) being coiled upon the box in the bows, it continues its way to the gunwale still a little further aft, and is then attached to the short-warp - the rope which is immediately connected with the harpoon; but previous to that connexion, the short-warp goes through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail.\n",

Ahab becomes fuelled with his need to slay the leviathan, but it wasn’t Ahab who droned on for three hundred pages about the properties of whales. Despite the allegorical interpretation between the relationship, and the comparisons between man and fish, the book is unnecessarily packed out. There are passages and passages that add nothing to the meaning or merit of the work. Melville explains every aspect of the whaling industry in dry, monotone, manner. There are entire chapters devoted to describing different whale types, and even one even discussing the superiority of the sperm whale’s head:\n",

See that amazing lower lip, pressed by accident against the vessel's side, as as firmly to embrace the jaw. Does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death? This Right Whale I take to have been a Stoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who might have taken up Spinoza in his latter years.\n",

I just felt there was no purpose to so many of the chapters; they didn’t add to the narrative or increase Ahab’s obsession. Also, at times it wasn’t entirely clear who the narrator was. There would be the occasional glimpse of Ishmael, and his aspect of the story, and then this all knowing entity with an unfathomable depth of whaling knowledge would begin up again.\n",

There is nothing noble about it, it may have once been a necessity, but it has always been cruel and brutal. It may have been a means for communities to survive and people to eat, but there is no honour in it. How can shoving a pole through a whale, cutting its head off, slicing away its blubber and desecrating its body be considered in any way praiseworthy? It’s an aspect of life that is comparable to man today slaughtering a cow. There is simply no glamour to be had in the deed. You’d think Melville was describing the life of a group of chivalrous knights; they were whalers not heroes.\n",

Reasonably enough, Moby Dick (hereafter M.D., despite possible confusions with the profession) is irritable when people are chasing him, stabbing him with harpoons, and trying to kill him. Thus, in an act which would be protected by law as self defense in most enlightened nations, M.D. bites off part of the leg of one of his many hunters, the humorless Captain Ahab.\n",

(He also holds a grudge for some incidental damage incurred to Lil' Ahab as a very weak corollary of his lost limb, but I'm not even getting into that. Judge Wapner would've never stomached that half-baked reasoning, so neither will I.) Now mind you, M.D. doesn't, like, come ashore in Nantucket, rent a lowrider horse-drawn carriage, and try to put a cap in the ass of that one-legged old bitch-ass captain who wanted to decapitate him. So, I mean, who's really the petty one in this equation?\n",

(Whaling was the Hollywood of that era.) He meets this reformed cannibal harpooner named Queequeg who hails from the South Seas, has lots of tattoos, and moonlights as a decapitated-human-head salesman. So basically he's rough trade. Ishmael and Queequeg become fast-friends and do all kinds of jovial homoerotic things together, like cuddle in bed and curiously espy each other undressing -- despite their pronounced cultural differences. I think Ishmael acts as a keen ethnographer when he highlights the variances: Queequeg, the savage, idol-worshipping, hell-condemned, unenlightened, \"oogah-boogah\" heathen, and Ishmael, the... white guy. Yet their love endures. It's as if all the sexual currents in Neil Simon's\n",

In other words, he gradually shifts from a compartmentalized first-person narrator to an omniscient third-person narrator. He seems almost to have rescinded his identity (or he only rarely invokes it) in the latter part of the novel, as if -- while we have been distracted by gloppy whale sperm and passing ships -- he morphed into the Star Child. This transformation is, of course, intentional and creates a sense of broadening perspective throughout the novel -- of transcending the menial and specific to embrace a grand, universal tragedy.\n",

The novel was a commercial failure and out of print at the time of the author's death in 1891, but during the 20th century, its reputation as a Great American Novel was established.

Ishmael, to the extent that he is in fact the narrator (more of a cypher, really, as things wear on) is a picaresque for sure. I found him charming, somewhat goofy, adventuresome, good natured, and rather high-spirited, which was a bit of a surprise. I liked him quite a bit. I also noticed part of the way through that he doesn't actually 'say' his name is Ishmael, he merely suggests (or demands) that you call him by that name. Interesting, no? And there's some back story on him but really not very much. You draw some inferences by his speech and his circumstances and his range of references, but like I said he's more or less ephemeral.\n",

I'd heard some sarcastic remarks before about the kind of interaction between Ishmael and Queequeg in the beginning, when they meet by accident in a room at an inn, but I was struck by how sort of undisguised it was. I have no issue or particular disapproval with it, morally or whatever, it was just surprising how unexplained and irreducible the homoerotic overtones were. There's an entire chapter, much later on, which can, in all honesty, be referred to as a kind of circle-jerk. I'm not kidding. Andrew Delbanco, in his brilliant and eloquent biography, quotes one of Melville's critics on this particular point. It's not hyperbole.\n",

Ishmael is a sort of neo-Platonist, it's true, and this is represented at various points. But nothing in this book is left to cool for very long, part of the tale involves his deep reckoning with that very philosophy, as applied to the perils and concrete realities of the world as experienced in an everyday way. The awareness on the part of Ishmael (and Melville himself, more on that in a moment) of his predecessors, literary and historical, is profound and constantly at play.\n",

Not to mention the deepening presence of Ahab as the story starts to heat up. He definitely becomes the central voice for much of the narrative and textual fabric of the story. And then there's quite a few extremely de-centered, Joycean passages where you aren't exactly sure what is real and what is taking place in a kind of polyphonic ensemble of dislocated, more or less decontextualized voices yammering on about god-knows-what.

There's a really deep sense of raw nature as an all-against-all on the boat itself, besides the fact that they are in direct competition with other ships for a possibly very lucrative and by no means guaranteed payday.\n",

And if there's any religion as a guiding light, it's decidedly of the Old Testament kind. The god of Moby-Dick ain't handing out any loaves and fishes, that's for sure.\n",

Is it possible there was some familial connection between whales and dogs? Or more troublingly, between these alien monsters of the deep and humans?

It is a difficult thing for an author not to give in and write something smaller and safer, something certain. It is Achilles' choice: to live a small and easy life, which will be long and passing pleasant, or to strike at the skies, to die in the flame of youth, and become a song.

As a Romance, it is not precisely concerned with developing holistic character psychology, it is enough to have types and archetypes, though they are often twisted.

They are all parts of a story, and while we may understand them by thinking about evil, or good, or fate, or faith, to try to boil them down to some simple meaning is to miss the point, and to turn a great story into nothing more than a fable. It is a mistake to go in asking 'what does this represent', it does the book a disservice. Asking this question is not necessary for us to understand the work.\n",

But it is not that this is a dark, hopeless book, but rather that it is a book which lacks simple, familiar answers. It does not wallow in the notion of hopelessness, but rather seems troubled by the fact that hope so often leads us to an inescapably hopeless place.\n",

So when one literary critic asked another what he thought of Moby Dick, he was asking what he was able to create from this basic toolset of ideas which had no simple, right answer.\n",

It is fundamentally a story about characters, and the only thing required to get it is to be a human being with an interest in other human beings. In fact, at one point, Melville makes a parody of the idea of the text which is full of allusions that only experts will understand, with the tale of 'Darmonodes and the elephant', which is not actually a real reference to anything, but was made up by Melville to tease those who are obsessed with dissecting every allusion.\n",

Though Melville, himself, only worked as a whaler for less than two years, he researched and compiled many different accounts to create his book. And these explorations of whaling, like the characters, all contribute to our understanding, they build meaning and help to color certain words and actions.\n",

As with most of the book, these are not obscure, nor do they make the action difficult to follow, they are just more example of Melville's playful experimentation.\n",

And yet, don't worry about taking everything away--that's a fool's errand--Melville did his best to write what he could, trying not to worry about whether it was all perfect, so the least we can do is to be bold enough to read it as it is, and take what we can from it, without worrying whether we've gotten all of it.\n",

I looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the man, who in mid-winter just landed from a four years’ dangerous voyage, could so unrestingly push off again for still another tempestuous term. The land seemed scorching to his feet. Wonderfullest things are ever the unmentionable; deep memories yield no epitaphs; this six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave of Bulkington. Let me only say that it fared with him as with the storm-tossed ship, that miserably drives along the leeward land. The port would fain give succor; the port is pitiful; in the port is safety, comfort, hearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all that’s kind to our mortalities. But in that gale, the port, the land, is that ship’s direst jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality; one touch of land, though it but graze the keel, would make her shudder through and through. With all her might she crowds all sail off shore; in so doing, fights ‘gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward; seeks all the lashed sea’s landlessness again; for refuge’s sake forlornly rushing into peril; her only friend her bitterest foe!\"\n",

Well, simply because the departures from the main narrative were often mind-numbing and effectively brought the momentum of the plot almost to a stand-still for me. Interspersed at frequent intervals among the compelling, fictional aspects of the book are a plethora of non-fictional descriptions of the whaling industry, the various species of whales, the anatomy of the whale, descriptions of whaling lines, whale processing (gruesome but sometimes interesting), whale paintings, whale writings, and whale ships.

Whenever I find myself involuntarily thinking about ditching town or becoming a beach bum; whenever the temptation to live in a Winnebago by the sea grips my soul; whenever I have the temptation to smack some smug coal-suited individual for his money barbarism, it's high time for another literary adventure. This is my substitute for a gambling addiction or alcoholism -- fine gentlemanly pursuits for some weary at heart, but not for me. With a cynical yet philosophical flourish, others go into the business world, I quietly start a new literary adventure, a new book review. There is nothing surprising in this.

You might feel the same way when Melville spends seven chapters in a row talking about the physiognomy of sperm whale heads.

I’m unsure of the timeline here, but I’m pretty positive that Melville was writing before the advent of thesauruses (thesauri?). Regardless, this half of the book is exactly what you would expect from a yarn of its sort. The sailors are a mixed bag of old sea dogs, young cabin boys enchanted by the glittering romance of the sea, and pagan harpooners living solely for the hunt. This segment of the story flies by like an albatross over the azure sea (prolonged exposure to this book has left me unable to make any non-nautical metaphors)- brisk, refreshing and nigh effortless.\n",

The second is more in line with the Naturalist writings of the 19th Century and is nothing less than a complete history and biology of whales, whale hunting, gutting whales, refining their blubber into oil, and the unique structural adjustments made to ships to allow the processing to take place while at sea. I have to admit, I thrilled at reading the first few of these chapters. Melville writes them well with great description of the inner workings of the sperm whale and I laughed at his chapter on how the placement of their eyes meant that whales were effectively blind- he was obviously writing before the discovery of sonar. Little-old 21st Century me liked the idea of having a piece of knowledge that Melville, for all of his in-depth research (and trust me, it's\n",

The pacing of the story fell off as I was treated to descriptions of the oxygen:water ratio in a whale's spume, descriptions of all known types of whales hunted by man, the bell tool used for scooping the valuable sperm from it's brain cavity or how the sperm whale possesses a thick and hard battering ram of a head with which it can defend against predators. I understood what Melville was doing- if he's not going to introduce the actual nemesis in this tale until the very end of the book then he's going to make damn sure that the reader knows just what this whale is capable of. It just dragged so slowly that by the time we did finally catch a glimpse of Moby, I greeted it with a sigh of \"finally\" rather than much excitement.\n",

Moby Dick is almost the same story except in a more old testament way, the hunter instead chooses to ignore or misunderstand all the warnings he is given. And as we are reminded in the book, ultimately the dogs licked King Ahab's blood (1 Kings 22). But I am getting entangling in my own line, let me cut myself free. Saint Hubertus' story was also mine own, for I turned my back on the glory of the White Whale until it came with a heavy splash after me and swallowed me whole even as Jonah was swallowed in days of old.\n",

The ship and it's crew can be taken as representing society, it is the ship of state (not to be confused with a stately ship), a ship of fools, an Odyssey - though in this case the end point of the voyage is not Ithaca but a more final resting place, a Quest not for the Golden Fleece but for the golden oil or a quest for something else, vengeance or self-destruction. It is a surprisingly straight retelling of the Biblical story of Ahab set in Melville's own times and translated to his 'modern' setting. In the Bible God brings down King Ahab by means of false prophecy, here Captain Ahab plugs his ears to the siren call of true prophecy clinging instead to the Delphic riddle of a Parsi (not that there is anything intrinsically wrong in harkening to the fortune telling of Parsis\n",

The eponymous whale is introduced to us through his actions and legends, but we barely meet him and in person only at the very end of the story, that he consists of massive symbolic power we are explicitly told, but what he symbolises is open to the reader to decide. The big old whale could of course just be a big old whale and not an incarnation of God or an agent of Divine will. The burden of symbolism and foreshadowing ought to be enough to make the poor Pequod capsize before she leaves harbour, but she bobs away prettily partly because of Melville's digressions on whaling and whales. Encyclopaedic diversions, which distract us from the vexing question of how in an Divine universe does a person distinguish between the false and the true prophets.\n",

Ahab himself denies responsibility - I don't think, I just feel - he tells us, but Ahab feels differently to other ship's captain's in similar situations, the solution then lies elsewhere: predestination maybe, fate perhaps, psychology even. From a broader point of view we are also shown that the whaling industry is both fundamental to Victorian society, but at the same time it's irreverent inversion. The married ship's officers are almost perpetually absent from their marriage beds, pausing there barely long enough to reproduce, the ship itself an idyll, a foretaste of heaven the narrator imagines when he participates in squeezing sperm on deck, gazing dreamily into his shipmate's eyes unable anymore to distinguish their sperm softened hands. Men of many nations and diverse faiths sail as one crew in an age that insisted on firm divisions between faiths, nations and races. The Narrator is married to the Polynesian Harpooner even before they join the ship, which they do as a couple, in this world a same-sex relationship is as normally abnormal as everything else. Society may be built upon whale oil, but the whaling business turns life on its head.\n",

The charismatic presence of this rage-fueled, iron-willed man—a skipper become absolute tyrant over the superstition-veined decency of Starbuck, the laugh-addled ineffectuality of Stubb, and the common-man ductility of Flask, let alone the pagan otherness of the swarthy harpooner triad—seems of a seaborne Napoleonic type who imperil their dominated collective, whatever system they maneuvered through to attain their preeminence. There are many futilities and fatalities and frailties that Melville delineated through the course of the book, and of which the narrator's curiosity-driven, malleable-formed openness to new experience and being expanded by life—rather than consumed in its ravenous operation, and during which obsessions ever emerge, full-formed, to burn the fuel faster and truer—was the only one that, fortune-kissed, proved able to survive the climactic tempest. I loved how Melville ejected Ishmael from Ahab's doomed boat as a nameless oarsmen set adrift, a nondescript figure seemingly served up as a bobbing meal for the encircling sharks—and it is only once the seas have calmed, and the tragedy been fully laid-bare, that this cipher, in a succinct italicized voice, reclaims the name of Ishmael with which he more forcefully and assuredly greeted the reader in what seemed a lifetime past.

No one had answers. It was a constant fight between the right thing and the wrong thing. And thus was born the giant struggle at the core of this book... it's not about trying to capture a whale or giant fish. It's what everything in the book symbolizes. But that's just the thing -- each reader takes something slightly different from the metaphors, allegories and metaphysical challenges being posed throughout the veins of this novel. For me, it was like reading Faust Part I by Goethe. Am I good or evil? And years later, I still have the same thoughts... not so much if am good or evil (Side Note: I'm evil, as most tell me)... but what's the right thing to do in any situation. There are always choices. Society will always judge you. That's life. That's humanity. I'd love to say it's only 10% but I'm fairly sure over 50% of our population judge when faced with this battle or societal game. It's a tough book to get through as you have to think about everything being said. You need to stop every few chapters and reflect. Plus, it's nearly 200 years old, so interpretation and values are much different.\n",

She wishes bubblegum wouldn\\'t lose its flavour. She wishes school would start in the afternoon. But above all, Sarah wishes she could remain a kid forever. When she receives an invitation to the mysterious House of Vine, a secret dwelling where reside two genii, her wishful thinking becomes all the more real.  A once in a lifetime opportunity awaits her, the chance to claim a single wish. But like those before her, Sarah must first agree to play a game. And it is a game of the deadliest kind, where terrors lurk behind every corner, where fiendish puzzles break her wits and where the clock shows her impending doom.

In the company of his faithful squire, Sancho Panza, his exploits blossom in all sorts of wonderful ways. While Quixote\\'s fancy often leads him astray—he tilts at windmills, imagining them to be giants—Sancho acquires cunning and a certain sagacity. Sane madman and wise fool, they roam the world together, and together they have haunted readers\\' imaginations for nearly four hundred years.\\n\\nWith its experimental form and literary playfulness, Don Quixote has been generally recognized as the first modern novel. The book has been enormously influential on a host of writers, from Fielding and Sterne to Flaubert, Dickens, Melville, and Faulkner, who reread it once a year, &quot;just as some people read the Bible.&quot;<\\/span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\"16009828780267384162\\\" href=\\\"#\\\" onclick=\\\"swapContent(\\$(this));; return false;\\\">...more<\\/a>\\n\\n    <\\/div>\\n\\n      <div class=\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\' id=\\'11_book_3836\\'>\\n<div class=\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\'>\\n<form action=\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\" accept-charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\" method=\\\"post\\\"><input name=\\\"utf8\\\" type=\\\"hidden\\\" value=\\\"&#x2713;\\\" /><input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"authenticity_token\\\" value=\\\"xFEn70gjMcz0BCzpoQbOcNTKzHUvKSYEPdMakmvH/sjDMnXFU0cZlhLD+WFUztKg3857DIbUJhDukv68Ysbstw==\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_id\\\" id=\\\"book_id\\\" value=\\\"3836\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"name\\\" id=\\\"name\\\" value=\\\"to-read\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"unique_id\\\" id=\\\"unique_id\\\" value=\\\"11_book_3836\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"wtr_new\\\" id=\\\"wtr_new\\\" value=\\\"true\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_choice\\\" id=\\\"from_choice\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_home_module\\\" id=\\\"from_home_module\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"ref\\\" id=\\\"ref\\\" value=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"existing_review\\\" id=\\\"existing_review\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" class=\\\"wtrExisting\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_origin\\\" id=\\\"book_origin\\\" value=\\\"related_works\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_referrer\\\" id=\\\"page_referrer\\\" value=\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/153747.Moby_Dick\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_url\\\" id=\\\"page_url\\\" value=\\\"/book/show/153747.Moby_Dick_or_the_Whale\\\" />\\n<button class=\\'wtrToRead\\' type=\\'submit\\'>\\n<span class=\\'progressTrigger\\'>Want to Read<\\/span>\\n<span class=\\'progressIndicator\\'>saving…<\\/span>\\n<\\/button>\\n<\\/form>\\n\\n<\\/div>\\n\\n<div class=\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\'>\\n<form class=\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\" action=\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\" accept-charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\" method=\\\"post\\\"><input name=\\\"utf8\\\" type=\\\"hidden\\\" value=\\\"&#x2713;\\\" /><input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"authenticity_token\\\" value=\\\"i4wHKCZ65wlULiSWKXoLuwjMQ31NJjQSQnB1OF3VExeM71UCPR7PU7Lp8R7cshdrA8j0BOTbNAaRMZEWVNQBaA==\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"unique_id\\\" id=\\\"unique_id\\\" value=\\\"11_book_3836\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_id\\\" id=\\\"book_id\\\" value=\\\"3836\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"a\\\" id=\\\"a\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"name\\\" id=\\\"name\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_choice\\\" id=\\\"from_choice\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_home_module\\\" id=\\\"from_home_module\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_origin\\\" id=\\\"book_origin\\\" value=\\\"related_works\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_referrer\\\" id=\\\"page_referrer\\\" value=\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/153747.Moby_Dick\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_url\\\" id=\\\"page_url\\\" value=\\\"/book/show/153747.Moby_Dick_or_the_Whale\\\" />\\n<\\/form>\\n\\n<button class=\\'wtrShelfButton\\'><\\/button>\\n<\\/div>\\n\\n<div class=\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\'>\\n<div class=\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\'>\\nError rating book.

After running away from the workhouse and pompous beadle Mr Bumble, Oliver finds himself lured into a den of thieves peopled by vivid and memorable characters - the Artful Dodger, vicious burglar Bill Sikes, his dog Bull\\'s Eye, and prostitute Nancy, all watched over by cunning master-thief Fagin. Combining elements of Gothic Romance, the Newgate Novel and popular melodrama, Dickens created an entirely new kind of fiction, scathing in its indictment of a cruel society, and pervaded by an unforgettable sense of threat and mystery.\\n\\nThis Penguin Classics edition of Oliver Twist is the first critical edition to faithfully reproduce the text as its earliest readers would have encountered it from its serialisation in Bentley\\'s Miscellany, and includes an introduction by Philip Horne, a glossary of Victorian thieves\\' slang, a chronology of Dickens\\'s life, a map of contemporary London and all of George Cruikshank\\'s original illustrations.\\n\\nFor more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

Renowned classicist Bernard Knox observes in his superb introduction that although the violence of the Iliad is grim and relentless, it coexists with both images of civilized life and a poignant yearning for peace.\\n \\nCombining the skills of a poet and scholar, Robert Fagles, winner of the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation and a 1996 Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, brings the energy of contemporary language to this enduring heroic epic. He maintains the drive and metric music of Homer’s poetry, and evokes the impact and nuance of the Iliad’s mesmerizing repeated phrases in what Peter Levi calls “an astonishing performance.”<\\/span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\"8639803401268648798\\\" href=\\\"#\\\" onclick=\\\"swapContent(\\$(this));; return false;\\\">...more<\\/a>\\n\\n    <\\/div>\\n\\n      <div class=\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\' id=\\'16_book_1371\\'>\\n<div class=\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\'>\\n<form action=\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\" accept-charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\" method=\\\"post\\\"><input name=\\\"utf8\\\" type=\\\"hidden\\\" value=\\\"&#x2713;\\\" /><input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"authenticity_token\\\" value=\\\"eHeERaCeZqQUAswnLoLVdCERFzinN9LPgPs8gAmwHIZ/FNZvu/pO/vLFGa/bSsmkKhWgQQ7K0ttTutiuALEO+Q==\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_id\\\" id=\\\"book_id\\\" value=\\\"1371\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"name\\\" id=\\\"name\\\" value=\\\"to-read\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"unique_id\\\" id=\\\"unique_id\\\" value=\\\"16_book_1371\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"wtr_new\\\" id=\\\"wtr_new\\\" value=\\\"true\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_choice\\\" id=\\\"from_choice\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_home_module\\\" id=\\\"from_home_module\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"ref\\\" id=\\\"ref\\\" value=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"existing_review\\\" id=\\\"existing_review\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" class=\\\"wtrExisting\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_origin\\\" id=\\\"book_origin\\\" value=\\\"related_works\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_referrer\\\" id=\\\"page_referrer\\\" value=\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/153747.Moby_Dick\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_url\\\" id=\\\"page_url\\\" value=\\\"/book/show/153747.Moby_Dick_or_the_Whale\\\" />\\n<button class=\\'wtrToRead\\' type=\\'submit\\'>\\n<span class=\\'progressTrigger\\'>Want to Read<\\/span>\\n<span class=\\'progressIndicator\\'>saving…<\\/span>\\n<\\/button>\\n<\\/form>\\n\\n<\\/div>\\n\\n<div class=\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\'>\\n<form class=\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\" action=\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\" accept-charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\" method=\\\"post\\\"><input name=\\\"utf8\\\" type=\\\"hidden\\\" value=\\\"&#x2713;\\\" /><input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"authenticity_token\\\" value=\\\"NU6ZlOEvKDRYl1cKSuPoBpTNV5HYHK+psi1kh7KEbdQyLcu++ksAbr5QgoK/K/TWn8ng6HHhr71hbICpu4V/qw==\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"unique_id\\\" id=\\\"unique_id\\\" value=\\\"16_book_1371\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_id\\\" id=\\\"book_id\\\" value=\\\"1371\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"a\\\" id=\\\"a\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"name\\\" id=\\\"name\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_choice\\\" id=\\\"from_choice\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_home_module\\\" id=\\\"from_home_module\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_origin\\\" id=\\\"book_origin\\\" value=\\\"related_works\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_referrer\\\" id=\\\"page_referrer\\\" value=\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/153747.Moby_Dick\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_url\\\" id=\\\"page_url\\\" value=\\\"/book/show/153747.Moby_Dick_or_the_Whale\\\" />\\n<\\/form>\\n\\n<button class=\\'wtrShelfButton\\'><\\/button>\\n<\\/div>\\n\\n<div class=\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\'>\\n<div class=\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\'>\\nError rating book.

He imagines himself to be a great man, a Napoleon: acting for a higher purpose beyond conventional moral law. But as he embarks on a dangerous game of cat and mouse with a suspicious police investigator, Raskolnikov is pursued by the growing voice of his conscience and finds the noose of his own guilt tightening around his neck. Only Sonya, a downtrodden prostitute, can offer the chance of redemption.<\\/span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\"264880809242188732\\\" href=\\\"#\\\" onclick=\\\"swapContent(\\$(this));; return false;\\\">...more<\\/a>\\n\\n    <\\/div>\\n\\n      <div class=\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\' id=\\'17_book_7144\\'>\\n<div class=\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\'>\\n<form action=\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\" accept-charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\" method=\\\"post\\\"><input name=\\\"utf8\\\" type=\\\"hidden\\\" value=\\\"&#x2713;\\\" /><input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"authenticity_token\\\" value=\\\"decFEhzkFTM+fRiHirty4tIWLqBX5gvjSTOW05FPKONyhFc4B4A9adi6zQ9/c24y2RKZ2f4bC/eacnL9mE46nA==\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_id\\\" id=\\\"book_id\\\" value=\\\"7144\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"name\\\" id=\\\"name\\\" value=\\\"to-read\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"unique_id\\\" id=\\\"unique_id\\\" value=\\\"17_book_7144\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"wtr_new\\\" id=\\\"wtr_new\\\" value=\\\"true\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_choice\\\" id=\\\"from_choice\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_home_module\\\" id=\\\"from_home_module\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"ref\\\" id=\\\"ref\\\" value=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"existing_review\\\" id=\\\"existing_review\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" class=\\\"wtrExisting\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_origin\\\" id=\\\"book_origin\\\" value=\\\"related_works\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_referrer\\\" id=\\\"page_referrer\\\" value=\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/153747.Moby_Dick\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_url\\\" id=\\\"page_url\\\" value=\\\"/book/show/153747.Moby_Dick_or_the_Whale\\\" />\\n<button class=\\'wtrToRead\\' type=\\'submit\\'>\\n<span class=\\'progressTrigger\\'>Want to Read<\\/span>\\n<span class=\\'progressIndicator\\'>saving…<\\/span>\\n<\\/button>\\n<\\/form>\\n\\n<\\/div>\\n\\n<div class=\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\'>\\n<form class=\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\" action=\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\" accept-charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\" method=\\\"post\\\"><input name=\\\"utf8\\\" type=\\\"hidden\\\" value=\\\"&#x2713;\\\" /><input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"authenticity_token\\\" value=\\\"O5zbjens30vbhcFKl/ywNBIrUfTRtm+kLoUWxj7k2X48/4mn8oj3ET1CFMJiNKzkGS/mjXhLb7D9xPLoN+XLAQ==\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"unique_id\\\" id=\\\"unique_id\\\" value=\\\"17_book_7144\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_id\\\" id=\\\"book_id\\\" value=\\\"7144\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"a\\\" id=\\\"a\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"name\\\" id=\\\"name\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_choice\\\" id=\\\"from_choice\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_home_module\\\" id=\\\"from_home_module\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_origin\\\" id=\\\"book_origin\\\" value=\\\"related_works\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_referrer\\\" id=\\\"page_referrer\\\" value=\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/153747.Moby_Dick\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_url\\\" id=\\\"page_url\\\" value=\\\"/book/show/153747.Moby_Dick_or_the_Whale\\\" />\\n<\\/form>\\n\\n<button class=\\'wtrShelfButton\\'><\\/button>\\n<\\/div>\\n\\n<div class=\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\'>\\n<div class=\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\'>\\nError rating book.

There he learns of a great hoard of treasure hidden on the Isle of Monte Cristo and he becomes determined not only to escape, but also to unearth the treasure and use it to plot the destruction of the three men responsible for his incarceration. Dumas’ epic tale of suffering and retribution, inspired by a real-life case of wrongful imprisonment, was a huge popular success when it was first serialized in the 1840s.\\n\\nRobin Buss’s lively English translation is complete and unabridged, and remains faithful to the style of Dumas’s original.

From the moment young Jim Hawkins first encounters the sinister Blind Pew at the Admiral Benbow Inn until the climactic battle for treasure on a tropic isle, the novel creates scenes and characters that have fired the imaginations of generations of readers. Written by a superb prose stylist, a master of both action and atmosphere, the story centers upon the conflict between good and evil - but in this case a particularly engaging form of evil. It is the villainy of that most ambiguous rogue Long John Silver that sets the tempo of this tale of treachery, greed, and daring. Designed to forever kindle a dream of high romance and distant horizons, Treasure Island is, in the words of G. K.

Odysseus\\' reliance on his wit and wiliness for survival in his encounters with divine and natural forces, during his ten-year voyage home to Ithaca after the Trojan War, is at once a timeless human story and an individual test of moral endurance. \\n\\nIn the myths and legends that are retold here, Fagles has captured the energy and poetry of Homer\\'s original in a bold, contemporary idiom, and given us an Odyssey to read aloud, to savor, and to treasure for its sheer lyrical mastery.\\n\\nRenowned classicist Bernard Knox\\'s superb Introduction and textual commentary provide new insights and background information for the general reader and scholar alike, intensifying the strength of Fagles\\' translation.\\n\\nThis is an Odyssey to delight both the classicist and the public at large, and to captivate a new generation of Homer\\'s students.\\n\\n--\\n\\nRobert Fagles, winner of the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation and a 1996 Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, presents us with Homer\\'s best-loved and most accessible poem in a stunning new modern-verse translation.<\\/span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\"953801395422012029\\\" href=\\\"#\\\" onclick=\\\"swapContent(\\$(this));; return false;\\\">...more<\\/a>\\n\\n    <\\/div>\\n\\n      <div class=\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\' id=\\'22_book_1381\\'>\\n<div class=\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\'>\\n<form action=\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\" accept-charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\" method=\\\"post\\\"><input name=\\\"utf8\\\" type=\\\"hidden\\\" value=\\\"&#x2713;\\\" /><input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"authenticity_token\\\" value=\\\"HtLhfVz8DZIeX9dRaucuJBqNhBkggl9cx7uEDDmx3bEZsbNXR5glyPiYAtmfLzL0EYkzYIl/X0gU+mAiMLDPzg==\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_id\\\" id=\\\"book_id\\\" value=\\\"1381\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"name\\\" id=\\\"name\\\" value=\\\"to-read\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"unique_id\\\" id=\\\"unique_id\\\" value=\\\"22_book_1381\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"wtr_new\\\" id=\\\"wtr_new\\\" value=\\\"true\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_choice\\\" id=\\\"from_choice\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_home_module\\\" id=\\\"from_home_module\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"ref\\\" id=\\\"ref\\\" value=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"existing_review\\\" id=\\\"existing_review\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" class=\\\"wtrExisting\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_origin\\\" id=\\\"book_origin\\\" value=\\\"related_works\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_referrer\\\" id=\\\"page_referrer\\\" value=\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/153747.Moby_Dick\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_url\\\" id=\\\"page_url\\\" value=\\\"/book/show/153747.Moby_Dick_or_the_Whale\\\" />\\n<button class=\\'wtrToRead\\' type=\\'submit\\'>\\n<span class=\\'progressTrigger\\'>Want to Read<\\/span>\\n<span class=\\'progressIndicator\\'>saving…<\\/span>\\n<\\/button>\\n<\\/form>\\n\\n<\\/div>\\n\\n<div class=\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\'>\\n<form class=\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\" action=\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\" accept-charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\" method=\\\"post\\\"><input name=\\\"utf8\\\" type=\\\"hidden\\\" value=\\\"&#x2713;\\\" /><input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"authenticity_token\\\" value=\\\"/QOqJaE9LtvV+Zc25AjhAQ2ulv6s2Y1yb8v960xj4R36YPgPulkGgTM+Qr4RwP3RBqohhwUkjWa8ihnFRWLzYg==\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"unique_id\\\" id=\\\"unique_id\\\" value=\\\"22_book_1381\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_id\\\" id=\\\"book_id\\\" value=\\\"1381\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"a\\\" id=\\\"a\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"name\\\" id=\\\"name\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_choice\\\" id=\\\"from_choice\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_home_module\\\" id=\\\"from_home_module\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_origin\\\" id=\\\"book_origin\\\" value=\\\"related_works\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_referrer\\\" id=\\\"page_referrer\\\" value=\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/153747.Moby_Dick\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_url\\\" id=\\\"page_url\\\" value=\\\"/book/show/153747.Moby_Dick_or_the_Whale\\\" />\\n<\\/form>\\n\\n<button class=\\'wtrShelfButton\\'><\\/button>\\n<\\/div>\\n\\n<div class=\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\'>\\n<div class=\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\'>\\nError rating book.

It is a story within a story, following a character named Charlie Marlow, who recounts his adventure to a group of men onboard an anchored ship. The story told is of his early life as a ferry boat captain. Although his job was to transport ivory downriver, Charlie develops an interest in investing an ivory procurement agent, Kurtz, who is employed by the government. Preceded by his reputation as a brilliant emissary of progress, Kurtz has now established himself as a god among the natives in “one of the darkest places on earth.” Marlow suspects something else of Kurtz: he has gone mad.\\n\\nA reflection on corruptive European colonialism and a journey into the nightmare psyche of one of the corrupted, Heart of Darkness is considered one of the most influential works ever written.<\\/span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\"5449807129422579219\\\" href=\\\"#\\\" onclick=\\\"swapContent(\\$(this));; return false;\\\">...more<\\/a>\\n\\n    <\\/div>\\n\\n      <div class=\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\' id=\\'23_book_4900\\'>\\n<div class=\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\'>\\n<form action=\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\" accept-charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\" method=\\\"post\\\"><input name=\\\"utf8\\\" type=\\\"hidden\\\" value=\\\"&#x2713;\\\" /><input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"authenticity_token\\\" value=\\\"mt98ORPfJmeRRmaVb3/R9UhBZkEN7cbmBf8oWDgbWSqdvC4TCLsOPXeBsx2at80lQ0XROKQQxvLWvsx2MRpLVQ==\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_id\\\" id=\\\"book_id\\\" value=\\\"4900\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"name\\\" id=\\\"name\\\" value=\\\"to-read\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"unique_id\\\" id=\\\"unique_id\\\" value=\\\"23_book_4900\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"wtr_new\\\" id=\\\"wtr_new\\\" value=\\\"true\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_choice\\\" id=\\\"from_choice\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_home_module\\\" id=\\\"from_home_module\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"ref\\\" id=\\\"ref\\\" value=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"existing_review\\\" id=\\\"existing_review\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" class=\\\"wtrExisting\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_origin\\\" id=\\\"book_origin\\\" value=\\\"related_works\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_referrer\\\" id=\\\"page_referrer\\\" value=\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/153747.Moby_Dick\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_url\\\" id=\\\"page_url\\\" value=\\\"/book/show/153747.Moby_Dick_or_the_Whale\\\" />\\n<button class=\\'wtrToRead\\' type=\\'submit\\'>\\n<span class=\\'progressTrigger\\'>Want to Read<\\/span>\\n<span class=\\'progressIndicator\\'>saving…<\\/span>\\n<\\/button>\\n<\\/form>\\n\\n<\\/div>\\n\\n<div class=\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\'>\\n<form class=\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\" action=\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\" accept-charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\" method=\\\"post\\\"><input name=\\\"utf8\\\" type=\\\"hidden\\\" value=\\\"&#x2713;\\\" /><input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"authenticity_token\\\" value=\\\"dKaJCOheiLpmsJOeejh1kAqL5xGGX3dT1zkILG7si6hzxdsi8zqg4IB3RhaP8GlAAY9QaC+id0cEeOwCZ+2Z1w==\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"unique_id\\\" id=\\\"unique_id\\\" value=\\\"23_book_4900\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_id\\\" id=\\\"book_id\\\" value=\\\"4900\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"a\\\" id=\\\"a\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"name\\\" id=\\\"name\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_choice\\\" id=\\\"from_choice\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_home_module\\\" id=\\\"from_home_module\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_origin\\\" id=\\\"book_origin\\\" value=\\\"related_works\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_referrer\\\" id=\\\"page_referrer\\\" value=\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/153747.Moby_Dick\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_url\\\" id=\\\"page_url\\\" value=\\\"/book/show/153747.Moby_Dick_or_the_Whale\\\" />\\n<\\/form>\\n\\n<button class=\\'wtrShelfButton\\'><\\/button>\\n<\\/div>\\n\\n<div class=\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\'>\\n<div class=\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\'>\\nError rating book.

At once a Gothic thriller, a passionate romance, and a cautionary tale about the dangers of science, Frankenstein tells the story of committed science student Victor Frankenstein. Obsessed with discovering the cause of generation and life and bestowing animation upon lifeless matter, Frankenstein assembles a human being from stolen body parts but; upon bringing it to life, he recoils in horror at the creature\\'s hideousness. Tormented by isolation and loneliness, the once-innocent creature turns to evil and unleashes a campaign of murderous revenge against his creator, Frankenstein.\\n\\nFrankenstein, an instant bestseller and an important ancestor of both the horror and science fiction genres, not only tells a terrifying story, but also raises profound, disturbing questions about the very nature of life and the place of humankind within the cosmos: What does it mean to be human? What responsibilities do we have to each other? How far can we go in tampering with Nature? In our age, filled with news of organ donation genetic engineering, and bio-terrorism, these questions are more relevant than ever.<\\/span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\"5273285851921478133\\\" href=\\\"#\\\" onclick=\\\"swapContent(\\$(this));; return false;\\\">...more<\\/a>\\n\\n    <\\/div>\\n\\n      <div class=\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\' id=\\'25_book_35031085\\'>\\n<div class=\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\'>\\n<form action=\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\" accept-charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\" method=\\\"post\\\"><input name=\\\"utf8\\\" type=\\\"hidden\\\" value=\\\"&#x2713;\\\" /><input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"authenticity_token\\\" value=\\\"vifQYO2cetGgJeGE1jmnN9lE2VhEJ1BFsS0wEb/dQgK5RIJK9vhSi0biNAwj8bvn0kBuIe3aUFFibNQ/ttxQfQ==\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_id\\\" id=\\\"book_id\\\" value=\\\"35031085\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"name\\\" id=\\\"name\\\" value=\\\"to-read\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"unique_id\\\" id=\\\"unique_id\\\" value=\\\"25_book_35031085\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"wtr_new\\\" id=\\\"wtr_new\\\" value=\\\"true\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_choice\\\" id=\\\"from_choice\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_home_module\\\" id=\\\"from_home_module\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"ref\\\" id=\\\"ref\\\" value=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"existing_review\\\" id=\\\"existing_review\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" class=\\\"wtrExisting\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_origin\\\" id=\\\"book_origin\\\" value=\\\"related_works\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_referrer\\\" id=\\\"page_referrer\\\" value=\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/153747.Moby_Dick\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_url\\\" id=\\\"page_url\\\" value=\\\"/book/show/153747.Moby_Dick_or_the_Whale\\\" />\\n<button class=\\'wtrToRead\\' type=\\'submit\\'>\\n<span class=\\'progressTrigger\\'>Want to Read<\\/span>\\n<span class=\\'progressIndicator\\'>saving…<\\/span>\\n<\\/button>\\n<\\/form>\\n\\n<\\/div>\\n\\n<div class=\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\'>\\n<form class=\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\" action=\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\" accept-charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\" method=\\\"post\\\"><input name=\\\"utf8\\\" type=\\\"hidden\\\" value=\\\"&#x2713;\\\" /><input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"authenticity_token\\\" value=\\\"Z+ul//FrY1uZvnJBmmmRkYXviv3Kr0JH4lj+OHT28XpgiPfV6g9LAX95p8lvoY1Bjus9hGNSQlMxGRoWfffjBQ==\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"unique_id\\\" id=\\\"unique_id\\\" value=\\\"25_book_35031085\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_id\\\" id=\\\"book_id\\\" value=\\\"35031085\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"a\\\" id=\\\"a\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"name\\\" id=\\\"name\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_choice\\\" id=\\\"from_choice\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_home_module\\\" id=\\\"from_home_module\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_origin\\\" id=\\\"book_origin\\\" value=\\\"related_works\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_referrer\\\" id=\\\"page_referrer\\\" value=\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/153747.Moby_Dick\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_url\\\" id=\\\"page_url\\\" value=\\\"/book/show/153747.Moby_Dick_or_the_Whale\\\" />\\n<\\/form>\\n\\n<button class=\\'wtrShelfButton\\'><\\/button>\\n<\\/div>\\n\\n<div class=\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\'>\\n<div class=\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\'>\\nError rating book.
